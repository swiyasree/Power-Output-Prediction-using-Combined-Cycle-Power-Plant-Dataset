This project explores regression modeling on the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The notebook walks through data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training to predict power output based on environmental conditions. This task highlights feature relationships and evaluates model performance on real-world energy data.
